*A mod about gelatin. Adds candy-based consumable buffs.*

As such, can be included in any modpack on any platform without prior
permission. We appreciate hearing about people using our mods, but you do not

Adds an item that gives you damage absorption, and an item that keeps
your hunger at least half full, with weird ways of obtaining them.

PRs welcome.
